# Prototag
Turn based tag

##v0.1

###Board size
7 x 10 tiles

###Win condition
The game ends when the accumulated steps everyone who's been tagged has walked is 100. The one who's tagged at the end of the game is the loser.

###Decide who starts
Every player throws the dice, the one with the highest value starts. If two or more players gets the same value, they go up against each others until one wins.

###Play rules
  * One can move only in straight and right angles.
  * The value of the dice is the maximum number of tiles one can move. One can chose to not move.
  * The next player is the one to the left of the previous player.
  * When the tagged player reaches a tile occupied by another player, they go up against each other in a battle of rock, paper, scissor to determine the new tagged player.
    * When the tagged player wins, the loser becomes the new tagged player. The winner is immune from any attack or card effects by the newly tagged player for three rounds.
    * If the tagged player loses in rock, paper, scissors, the game continues as normal.
    * In any case, both players stay put at the same tile and the round continues as normal.
  * Players cannot move through each other.

###Cards
At special points on the board players can draw action cards. Action cards have different effects and can be played on your own turn, unless otherwise noted on the card.
 * **The wall** - You may place or move a 1x3 wall on the playing field. Players can't move through a wall. (There are only 2 wall tokens)
 * **Immunity** - Get immunity from the active player. If someone else has the immunity token, you take it from them. Lasts 1 round.
 * **Wormhole** - Place or move the 2 wormhole tokens on the board. Travelling from one to another costs one "step". (There are only 2 wormhole tokens)
 * **Teleport** - Roll 2 dice. Place your character on the "coordinate" rolled on the board. If the space is already occupied, you're tagged instead.
 * **Run** - Move 2 spaces in any direction, in addition to your normal die roll.
 * **Lucky** - Reroll 1 die.

###Notes
Played during a lunch break Nov. 16th.
It kind of worked. The last 1/3 of the game was the most intense and fun. It seems like having a small board is good. It didn't always take too long for the tagged player to catch up with the others. 100 accumulated steps was maybe a bit too long. If the rules changes, it might not.
There were a few flaws and side effects.
 - Not being able to move through each other made it possible to block a player. A group of players are sure to attract the tagged player. Staying in a tight group poses a higher risk for all players since they are in immediate risk of becoming tagged.
 - Being immune for as long as the losing (in rock, paper, scissor) player stays tagged was not the best rule. It was a little boring for the immune player. He can sabotage for other players by blocking them, but that's not always an option. It's also a little boring for the newly tagged player since he cannot immediately retaliate. And being far away from the others makes a little daunting to starting hunting them down.
 - Not being forced to walk as many tiles as indicated by the dice made the game a little static from time to time.
