###Notes
Played during a lunch break Nov. 24th.

It was an experiment to see what could be done to make the game quicker and more engaging for all players. It turned out to be a little too quick.

We noticed an increased level of strategy during the movement phase, probably due to the obstacles. You were led to consider both short and long term consequences of your positioning. Position yourself where you can shoot someone, and also try to stay out of sight for the next players.

The main flaw was that the weakest player drew all the attention of the others. It emerged as a survival strategy since the game would be over as soon as someone died. It's a way of protecting oneself.
